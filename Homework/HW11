You have five problems.

1. We frequently use the thermal voltage.
At 300 K, its value is approximately 25.85 mV.
In this problem, write down the exact expression to calculate the thermal voltage.
With the exact expression, calculate the thermal voltage at 77 K, 300 K, and 350 K.

2. We have stduied the IV relation of a PN junction. (Assume a forward bias, V>0, and 300 K.)

I = I_S exp (V/V_T),
where I_S is the reverse saturation current. 
(In photodiodes, it is also called the dark current. However, in this course, the reverse saturation current would be a correct name.)

In this problem, assume that I_S is 1e-16 A.
Draw the IV curve with the maximum y-axis value of 10 mA.
Then, estimate a voltage required to turn on your PN junction.

In your answer, you must show both of the IV curve and the estimated voltage.

3. Now, consider a different PN junction with I_S = 1e-14 A.
Once again, draw the IV curve with the maximum y-axis value of 10 mA.
Your curve is a shifted version of the one in P2.
By comparing two curves, estimate the amount of the voltage shift. 

4. In the lecture, we have studied that we must apply a small, additional voltage (V_T * log(10)) to increase the current by a factor of 10.
In this problem, just show the same result with your own derivation.

5. Consider the following netlist:

v1 in 0 dc 1
d1 in out is=0.1f
r1 out 0 1k

It represent a circuit, where a diode (d1) and a resistor (r1) are serially connected.
"v1 in 0 dc 1" means a dc voltage source of 1 V.
The "in" node is 1 V. (0 is reserved for the ground.)
"d1 in out is=0.1f" means a diode whose anode is connected to the "in" node, while its cathode is connected to the "out" node.
Its I_S value is 1e-16 A (= 0.1 fA).
Finally, "r1 out 0 1k" means a resistor whose resistance is 1 kOhm.

Calculate the current.
(There can be many different ways to find out the answer. It's up to you.)
