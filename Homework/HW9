HW9

Due: AM 08:00, April 4, 2022

You have four problems.

1. In the Lecture9, it was found that the drift current density cancels out the diffusion current density at equilibrium.
To be more accurate, the electron current density (which includes both), J_n, is given by
J_n = q mu_n n E + q D_n dn/dx,
where mu_n is the electron mobility (cm^2/V sec) and E is the magnitude of the x-directional electric field (V/cm).
Other quantities have the same physical meanings. (You saw them in the HW8.)

In this problem, just calculate the magnitude of the electric field, E, to cancel out the diffusion current density.
Feel the number. 
Consider two extremes:
1) n = 1e20 /cm^3 
2) n = 1e3 /cm^3

Use the following constants:

q = 1.6e-19 C (Throughout this lecture, we will use the absolute elementary charge, q. An electron carries the charge of -q.)
mu_n = 1000 cm^2/V sec (cm^2 is divided by both V and sec.)
D_n = 25 cm^2/sec (Actaully, there exists a relation between mu_n and D_n at equilibrium. But, in this problem, just use this number.)
dn/dx = (1e20 /cm^3) / (100 nm)

2. Well, from P1, we realize that the electric field is really dependent on the position.
Of course, our assumption of a constant dn/dx is not valid.

In this problem, derive a relation between the electron density and the electrostatic potential, phi. 
Of course, your relation is valid at equilibrium.

What is the electrostatic potential? 
It satisfies the following relation:
E = - d(phi)/dx.

Additionally, use the following relation between mu_n and D_n:
D_n = V_T * mu_n,
where V_T is a constant called the thermal voltage. (Yes, it is a voltage. At 300 K, its value is about 0.02585 V, but just keep the symbol.)

Hint: Note that J_n = 0 at equilibrium. Use the relation between E and phi.

3. Repeat P2 for holes.
In this case, we have
J_p = q mu_p p E - q D_p dp/dx,
where the subscript p is used for hole-related quantities and the sign for the diffusion term is changed.
Of course, we still have the following relation:
D_p = V_T * mu_p,
where mu_p can be different with mu_n in general. (Usually, mu_p is lower that mu_n.)

4. Now, from P2 & P3, we find that the electron density, the hole density, and the electric field can vary drastically inside the PN junction.
Therefore, it is not trivial to calculate those quantities accurately.
In this problem, under the given charge distribution, just calculate the electric field as a function of x.

It is assumed that we have the following charge distribution:
When x < -0.1 nm, it is neutral.
When -0.1 nm < x < 0, a constant charge density, +q * 1e20 /cm^3.
When 0 < x < 100 nm, a constant charge density, -q * 1e17 /cm^3.
When x > 100 nm, it is neutral.

In order to solve this problem, you must employ the Gauss law,
d(E)/dx = rho / epsilon,
where rho is the charge density (specified above) and epsilon is the permittivity.
For silicon, epsilon is 11.7 times the vacuum permittivity.
