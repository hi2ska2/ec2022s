You have two problems.

1. In the Lecture6, we have discussed about the diamond structure.
Consider a single unit cube of the diamond structure. 
Since it is a three-dimensional object, it is difficult for us to understand it.
A projection of a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional plane can be a good way to improve the visibility.
In this problem, draw the cube projected onto the following three different planes.
One is the y-z plane, which is perpendicular to the (1,0,0) vector.
Another one is a plane perpendicular to the (1,1,0) vector.
The last one is a plane perpendicular to the (1,1,1) vector.

2. Now we know that the intrinsic carrier densityt of silicon at 300 K is about 1e10 /cm3.   
Compare this number with those of other semiconductors.
In your report, at least, include Ge, GaAs, GaN, and SiC.
(You don't have to calculate them. Search them and write the answer. Show your reference.)
