1. We have discussed the simplest circuit. (A voltage source and a resistor.)
It generates a matrix system, where a 10-by-10 matrix is involved.
Using the computer programming, solve the system.
(The voltage and resistance can be freely set.) 

2. Repeat the same problem 1.
However, in this problem, instead of a voltage source, consider a current source.
(The current and resistance can be freely set.)

3. The divergence of the total current vector vanishes.
From this rule, show that the sum of terminal currents (of any N-terminal circuit element) should vanish.
