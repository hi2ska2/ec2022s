You have two problems. The third one is cancelled.

1. We have discussed the simplest circuit. (A voltage source and a resistor.)
It generates a matrix system, where a 10-by-10 matrix is involved.
Using the computer programming, solve the system.
(The voltage and resistance can be freely set.) 

2. Repeat the same problem 1.
However, in this problem, instead of a voltage source, consider a current source.
(The current and resistance can be freely set.)

3. (Cancelled)
