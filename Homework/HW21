You have three problems.

1. We have studied the impedance.
When the angular frequency, omega, is given, write down the impedances of a resistor R, a capacitor C, and an inductor L.

2. In the lecture, we tried to solve the KCL for the X node.
Note that the X node is a node where a capacitor C and two resistors, R1 and R2, are met.
Calculate the solution of the KCL by solving the ODE (ordinary differential equation) originated from the KCL.

In this case, you may assume that the small-signal input, v_in(t), exhibits a sinusoidal waveform with an angular frequency, omega.

3. Instead of solving the ODE, by using the impedances, calculate the voltage of the X node, V_X.
Yes, we did it in the lecture, but, do it by yourself.
