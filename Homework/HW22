You have three problems.

1. In the lecture, we have introduced an equivalent circuit for the common-source amplifier.
In this problem, just repeat the lecture material.
Draw the equivalent circuit and derive the voltage gain. 

2. As shown in P1, the voltage gain is proportioanl to the equivalent resistance, r_out || R_D.
In our initial design, r_out >> R_D.
In order to make the equivalent resistance large, R_D is increased, expecting that the voltage gain is increased accordingly.
However, we cannot obtain an indefinitely large voltage gain.
What is the maximum voltage gain (in the absolute value), achievable by increasing R_D?

Note: Assume that the transistor is still in the saturation mode.

3. Up to now, we have assumed that the output node (the drain terminal) is connected to only the NMOSFET and R_D.
In this problem, an additional resistor, R_L, is connected to the output node.
Once again, derive the voltage gain.
