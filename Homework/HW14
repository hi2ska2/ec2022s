You have only onee problem.

1. Consider a parallel plate capacitor.
The effective thickness of its insulator layer is 1 nm.
It means that you may regard its insulator layer as a 1-nm-thick SiO2 layer.
Calculate the capacitance per area. (F/cm^2)
Assume that the relative permittivity of SiO2 is 3.9.
