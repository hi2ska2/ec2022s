You have six problems.

1. Consider a circuit studied in the lecture.
For the MOSFET, we have the following parameters:
mu_n * C_ox = 100 uA/V^2, V_TH = 0.5 V, W = 10 um, and L = 180 nm.
The resistance of the resistor connected to the drain terminal is 1 kOhm.
Assume that V_DD is 1.8 V.

Calculate the input voltage, when the transistor is at the border between the triode mode and the saturation one.

2. For the same circuit, calculate the output voltage, when the input voltage is V_DD.

3. Calculate the maximum value of -d(V_out)/d(V_in).
Note that we have (-) sign, because d(V_out)/d(V_in) is non-positive.

4. Repeat P1 with a wider MOSFET with W = 50 um.
All other values are the same with P1.

5. Similarly, repeat P2 with a wider MOSFET with W = 50 um.

6. Similarly, repeat P3 with a wider MOSFET with W = 50 um.
