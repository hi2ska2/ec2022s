You have four problems.

1. We have studied the inversion in the MOS structure.
Let us denote the inversion electron sheet density (/cm^2) as N_inv.
Then, the charge sheet density due to the inversion electrons, Q_inv (C/cm^2), is given by
Q_inv = (-q) * N_inv.
In the simplest form, it can be written as 
Q_inv = 0, when V_G < V_TH,
Q_inv = -C_ox * (V_G - V_TH), when V_G > V_TH,
The negative sign is introduced, because the electrons have negative charges.

Now, consider a MOS structure whose effective oxide thickness is 1 nm.
The threshold voltage, V_TH, is assumed to be 0.25 V.
Calculate N_inv when the gate voltage is 0.7 V.

2. Visit ec2022s/Resources/L15.pdf in our GitHub repository.
There, you can find the first graph.
The red curve represents -Q_inv as a function of V_G.
You can find that the approximate expressions in P1 fit well. 
(Ignore the smooth transition between V_G < V_TH and V_G > V_TH.)
From this curve, estimate C_ox (C/cm^2) and V_TH (V).

3. Although we assumed Q_inv = 0 when V_G < V_TH in P1 and P2, Q_inv is not exactly zero at a low gate voltage.
The second graph of ec2022s/Resources/L15.pdf in our GitHub repository (especially the red curve) shows -Q_inv in the semi-log scale.
Calculate the ratio of N_inv between V_G = 0.4 V and V_G = 1.0 V.

4. 
Assume that the red curve in the second graph of ec2022s/Resources/L15.pdf in our GitHub repository is still a straight line down to V_G = 0.0 V.
Then, estimate N_inv at V_G = 0.0 V.
Using this estimate value, calculate the ratio of N_inv between V_G = 0.0 V and V_G = 1.0 V.
