You have two problems. 

1. In the Lecture4, we have discussed about a periodic waveform.
Within an interval from 0 sec to 1 sec, it looks like

f(t) = sin (2*pi*t) for 0   <= t <= 0.5
f(t) = 0            for 0.5 <= t <= 1.0

And it is repeated with a period of 1 sec.

For a non-negative integer, n, integrate the following functions over a period:

f(t) * cos (2*pi*n*t)
f(t) * sin (2*pi*n*t)

Hint: Consider two cases: n = 0 and n = a positive integer. 

2. Consider a two-terminal circuit element, whose IV relation is given as

I_2 = G * (V_2-V_1 - V_on) for V_2 - V_1 >= V_on,
I_2 = 0                    for V_2 - V_1 <  V_on,

where the underscore (_) is introduced to represent the subscript, G is a certain number in the Simens unit, and V_on is a given positive voltage.

In the Lecture4, we have introduced a circuit, which can convert an AC voltage to a DC voltage.
Assume the the above circuit element is used as the nonlinear element.
Draw the output voltage as a function of t. (The amplitude and frequency of the input voltage source are V_amp and f, respectively.)
