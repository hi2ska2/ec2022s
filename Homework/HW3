You have two problems. 

1. There is a file format called the netlist.
In the netlist, there are several lines.
Each line specifies a circuit element.
The starting letter defines its type. (v is for a voltage source and r is for a resistor.)
The first word is its name.
Then, the second and third words are the connected nodes.
The final fourth word (a number) represent either the voltage (of a voltage source) or the resistance (of a resistor).

For example, a netlist file

v1 out 0 0.7
r1 out 0 1.0

describes a circuit with a voltage source (v1) and a resistor (r1).
The second terminals of these circuit elements are connected to the ground (0).
Their first terminaals are connected to a node called out. 
Of course, the current will be 0.7 A.

Up to now, it was a simplified description about the netlist file format. 
Now we have the problem.
Consider a netlist shown below.
Calculate the cathode voltage.

v1 batt 0 1.5
rchar batt anode 1e6
rpcss anode cathode 21
rload cathode 0 50

2. Consider a two-terminal circuit element, whose IV relation is given as

I_2 = G * (V_2-V_1) for V_2 - V_1 >=0,
I_2 = 0             for V_2 - V_1 < 0,

where the underscore (_) is introduced to represent the subscript and G is a certain number in the Simens unit.

For such an circuit element, the following sinusoidal voltage difference is applied:

V_2 - V_1 = sin( 2 * pi * t )

Of course, t is the time.
Therefore, the frequency is 1 Hz and the peak voltage difference can be either +1 V or -1 V.
Draw I_2 as a function of t.
