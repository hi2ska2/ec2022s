You have three problems.

1. In the Lecture7, we have discussed about the impurities.
By introducing the impurity atoms, we can control the number of charge carriers (holes and electrons).
However, the fabrication method to introduce the impurity atoms was not discussed.
The most representative method is the ion implantation.
Write a report on the ion implantation.
(Show your reference.)

2. By solving the first problem, now you know the ion implantation.
Let's assume that the impurity atoms are ion implanted.
For a unit area of 1 cm^2, seen from the wafer top surface, the number of implanted atoms is 1e13.
Also, the implanted atoms are uniformly distributed within 200 nm from the wafer surface.
In the implanted region, calculate the (uniform) ion concentration, which has a unit of /cm^3.

3. In the Lecture8, we will learn about the current conduction mechanisms.
In order to prepare the Lecture8, remember the concept of the electric field.
You have a two-terminal element.
It has a left terminal and a right one.
The distance between two terminals is 1 um. 
(We must write micrometer = 1e-6 m here, however, the ascii file does not allow the Greek letter, mu. 
So, 1 um = 1 micrometer in this problem. 
However, use the Greek letter mu, whenever possible.)
The left terminal is biased as 0 V.
The right terminal is biased as 1 V.
Calculate the electric field, which has a unit of V/cm.
Also, write down the direction of the electric field.
(You know that the electric field is a vector quantity.)
Assume that the electric field is uniform.
