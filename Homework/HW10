You have three problems.

1. This problem considers a case quite similar with P4 of HW9.

Consider a PN junction (N+: 1e20 /cm^3 and P: 1e17 /cm^3) at equilibrium.
It is assumed that we have the following charge distribution: (Caution! Lengths are slightly modified.)
When x < -0.12 nm, it is neutral.
When -0.12 nm < x < 0, a constant charge density, +q * 1e20 /cm^3.
When 0 < x < 120 nm, a constant charge density, -q * 1e17 /cm^3.
When x > 120 nm, it is neutral.
You can easily calculate the electric field, as in P4 of HW9.

The problem is to calculate the electrostatic potential (phi) difference between two sides (x = - infinity and x = + infinity).

Remember the following relation:
E = - d(phi)/dx.

So, what you have to do is...
First, calculate E as a function of x. (You did a similar job for P4 of HW9.)
Next, integrated (-E) from x = - infinity to x = + infinity. Then, you will have the potential difference, phi(x = + infinity) - phi(x = - infinity).

It is noted that your answer must have a negative value.

2. P1 was for a PN junction at equilibrium.
Now, consider the same junction with a forward bias voltage of 0.1 V.
The depletion region (120 nm + 0.12 nm at equilibrium) gets narrower.
Calculate the width of the depletion region.

Hint: Set the depletion region widths (W_n for the N+ side and W_p for the P side) as two unknown variables. 
Of course, their ratio is fixed as W_n:W_p = 1:1000.
Try to find out W_p, with which the electrostatic potential difference becomes (The solution of P1) + 0.1 V.
Here, (The solution of P1) is a negative number, as stated above.

3. Repeat P2 with a reverse bias voltage of 0.1 V.
In this case, the depletion region gets wider.

Hint: Yes, the same approach with P2. 
Just try to find out W_p, with which the electrostatic potential difference becomes (The solution of P1) - 0.1 V.
