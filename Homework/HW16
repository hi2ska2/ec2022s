You have only one problem.

1. We have an NMOSFET, whose source and body are tied and connected to the ground.
(The NMOSFET is the device studied in the lecture.)
Both of the gate and drain terminals are biased to 0.65 V.
The drain current is 56 uA. (We must write the Greek letter, mu, but it is not possible in the GitHub respository.)
Calculate the DC power consumption by the MOSFET.
