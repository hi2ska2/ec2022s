You have five problems.

1. Write a report on the SPICE program.
(Show your references explicitly.) 

2. At the end of L12, the Newton method was introduced.
Simply speaking, the Newton method lets you know how to improve your temporary solution to reduce the error.
Write a report on the Newton method.
(Show your reference explicitly.)

3. Solve x^2 - 1 = 0 by the Newton method.
The initial solution is assumed to be x = 2.
Show your solution procedure to obtain x = 1. (Very close to 1)

4. For a resistor, we have
I = V / R.
Assume that I is I_dc when V is V_dc. (V_dc and I_dc are certain numbers.)
Express dI/dV | V=V_dc, in terms of I_dc and R. (V_dc should be avoided in your expression.)

Hint: It's a trivial problem.

5. For a diode, we have
I = I_S ( exp(V/V_T) - 1 ).
Assume that I is I_dc when V is V_dc. (V_dc and I_dc are certain numbers.)
Express dI/dV | V=V_dc, in terms of I_dc, I_S, and V_T. (V_dc should be avoided in your expression.)

Hint: It's a really simple problem.
