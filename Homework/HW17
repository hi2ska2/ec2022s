You have three problems.
You may (or may not) use the computer software.

1. Consider an NMOSFET.
Its parameters are:
t_ox = 1.2 nm, L = 1 um, W = 1um, mu_n = 500 cm^2/V, and V_TH = 0.3 V.

By using an expession studied in the lecture, draw the I_D versus V_G curve, when V_D = 0.05 V.
(Draw in the linear-linear scale.)

2. For the same NMOSFET, draw the I_D versus V_G curve, when V_D = 1.1 V.
(Draw in the linear-linear scale.)

3. For the same NMOSFET, draw the I_D versue V_D curves with various V_G values.
In this case, consider V_G = 0.4 V, 0.5 V, ..., 1.1 V.
