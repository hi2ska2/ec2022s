You have three problems.

1. Consider a common-source amplifier. 
In its input terminal, a voltage source, v_in, and a resistor, R_in, are serially connected.
Also in its output terminal, a load resistor, R_L, is connected.

In this problem, calculate the voltage gain.
Neglect the internal output resistance of the NMOSFET, which was written as r_out in our lecture.

2. Now, repeat the same problem, P1, with r_out.

3. Due to the time limitation, we have not covered other amplifier topologies.
In this problem, consider a common-gate amplifier. (What is it? Find it in the textbook.)
Its input terminal is now the source terminal.
In its input terminal, a voltage source, v_in, and a resistor, R_in, are serially connected.
Also in its output terminal, a load resistor, R_L, is connected.

Neglect r_out of the NMOSFET, and calculate the voltage gain.
