You have two problems. 

1. In the Lecture5, we have discussed the number of silicon atoms per cubic cm.
Calculate it.

Hint: In order to calculate it, you must understand the crystal structure of silicon.
Silicon has the diamond structure. (What is it? Search it.)
First, calculate the total number of atoms inside a cubic cell of the diamond structure.
Next, calculate the cell volume. (This is silicon's material property. Search it.)
From these two quantities, you can calculate the density. 

2. When a semiconductor material is in its purest condition (intrinsic material), 
the number of "electrons" (here, the term, "electrons," refers the electrons which can contribute to the currnet conduction.) is called the intrinsic carrier density.
What is the intrinsic carrier density of silicon at 300 K?
(You don't have to calculate it. Search it and write the answer. Show your reference.)
