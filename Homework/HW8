You have two problems.

1. In the Lecture8, a relation, n * p = n_i^2 , was shown.
(Note that it is valid at certain special cases. For a while, assume that it is valid.)
Consider a N-type semiconductor.
The donor density is given as N_D. (Of course, N_D is a positive number.)
By applying the charge neurality, -n + p + N_D = 0, express n as a function of N_D.
(Of course, we know that n becomes close to N_D, when we have a large N_D value. This problem asks you a general expression.)

2. In the Lecture8, it was stated that electrons in the N-type region diffuse into the P-type region.
This problem is introduced to show that the above statement is wrong.

Consider a N^+ P junction, whose doping densities are 1e20 /cm^3 and 1e17 /cm^3, respectively.
Assume that the jucntion is wide, when it is seen from the wafer top surface.
Therefore, we can say that the junction is actually one-dimensional (along the vertical direction).
The diffusion current density, J(A/cm^2), can be obtained by 
J = q D_n dn/dx,
where q is the absolution elementary charge (~ 1.6e-19 C), 
D_n is the electron diffusivity (whose value is assumed to be 25 cm^2/sec), 
and dn/dx is the gradient of the electron density. 

In this problem, the direction of the diffusion current density vector is not important. Just calculate the magnitude.
In order to get the answer, we must know dn/dx.
In your answer, consider the following three cases:
1) The electron density varies linearly (from the N-type value to the P-type value) within 1 nm.
2) The electron density varies linearly (from the N-type value to the P-type value) within 10 nm.
3) The electron density varies linearly (from the N-type value to the P-type value) within 100 nm.

By solving this problem, you can feel that something is wrong...
Let's solve such a difficulty in the Lecture9!
