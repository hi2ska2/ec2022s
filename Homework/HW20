You have three problems.

1. Consider an amplifier studied in the lecture.
For the MOSFET, we have the following parameters:
mu_n * C_ox = 100 uA/V^2, V_TH = 0.5 V, W = 10 um, and L = 180 nm.
The resistance of the resistor connected to the drain terminal is 1 kOhm.
Assume that V_DD is 1.8 V.

Calculate the voltage gain (Note that it is negative.) when the gate DC voltage is 0.6 V.

2. Repeat P1 when the gate DC voltage is 1.8 V.

3. Calculate the maximum voltage gain. (Of course, maximize the absolute value of the voltage gain.)
Show the gate DC voltage for the maximum voltage gain.
